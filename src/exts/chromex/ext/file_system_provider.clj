   system was shutdown. The last tag can be obtained with 'getAll'.To use, the file_system_provider.notify manifest option
   must be set to true.Value of tag can be any string which is unique per call, so it's possible to identify the last
   registered notification. Eg. if the providing extension starts after a reboot, and the last registered notification's tag
   is equal to '123', then it should call 'notify' for all changes which happened since the change tagged as '123'. It cannot
   be an empty string.Not all providers are able to provide a tag, but if the file system has a changelog, then the tag can be
   eg. a change number, or a revision number.Note that if a parent directory is removed, then all descendant entries are also
   removed, and if they are watched, then the API must be notified about the fact. Also, if a directory is renamed, then all
   descendant entries are in fact removed, as there is no entry under their original paths anymore.In case of an error,
   'runtime.lastError' will be set will a corresponding error code.
